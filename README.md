### Notes:

-   Receive an Complex Object as params instead of primitive types
-   To decouple a Classes, create an interface and inject it.
-   Implement Factories to keep class instanciation centralized
-   Testing Practices:
    -   SUT: System Under Test
    -   MockFunction: It's used for testing INPUT values
    -   StubFunction: It's used for testing OUTPUT values
    -   SpyFunction: It's used for testing INPUT and OUTPUT values.
